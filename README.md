LENNY
=====

The one and only portfolio pet

## Overview
Lenny is a little svg shape living in a big svg viewbox aquarium. Therefore, if you want to collaborate on it XML and JS will make your brain bleed most likely.

## Behavior and interaction
Lenny's behavior for now is defined by:
- bumping into edges: it changes color and shape
- feeding(aka button clicks): it scales up for 3 sec

Lenny will however learn to change its plain color to animated gradients when feeding and poop in the nearest future.

## Known bugs
If you're unfortunate and feed Lenny exactly in the second it bumps into an edge, you will see a beautiful but unindented glitch. Fix coming up.
